# ParabolaJS
A visual path generator for mobile robots using quadratic equations

## About
ParabolaJS uses a visual canvas graph in order to model autonomous movements of mobile wheeled robots.
The point is to be able to round objects based off of the y=x^2 parent graph.
It uses quadratic equations in order to develop a visual path through a coordinate plane.
